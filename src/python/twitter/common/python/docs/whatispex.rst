What are .pex files?
********************

tl;dr
"""""

.pex files are just carefully constructed zip files with a ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` and
special ``__main__.py``

Why .pex files?
====================

Files with the .pex extension -- "PEX files" or ".pex files" -- are
self-contained executable Python virtual environments.  PEX files make it
easy to deploy Python applications: the deployment process becomes simply
``scp``.


How do .pex files work?
=======================

PEX files rely on a quirk in the Python importer that considers the presence
of a ``__main__.py`` within the module as a signal to treat that module as
an executable.  For example, ``python -m my_module`` or ``python my_module``
will execute ``my_module/__main__.py`` if it exists.

Because of the flexibility of the Python import subsystem, ``python -m my_module`` works
regardless if ``my_module`` is on disk or within a zip file.  Adding
``#!/usr/bin/env python`` to the top of a .zip file containing a
``__main__.py`` and and marking it executable will turn it into an
executable Python program.  twitter.common.python takes advantage of this
feature in order to build executable .pex files.
